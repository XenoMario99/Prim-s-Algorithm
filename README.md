# Prim-s-Algorithm
Prim's algorithm is an algorithm that creates minimal spanning tree basing on 
consistent undirected weighted graph.
The implementation is based on greedy algorithm approach.
Input data: Consistent undirected weighted graph represented as 2D array W, which rows and columns are indexed from 0 do n-1, 
where n is a number of vertices comprised in the graph, and element W[i][j] is the weight of the edge between the vertices i and j.  
Output data: The set of edges F in minimal spanning tree of the given graph.
